# TIC TAC TOE AI
Hey there! This repo is intended to store my Min-Max algorithm study project. I'm currently getting started in the study of search algorithms in the wide world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and really wanned to explore the theory in a practical exercise.

This project is not intended to be a masterpiece of software engineering. It is just a exercise to comprehend the possibilities of a simple "AI" algorithm. Anyways, kind hints or advices are very welcome.
